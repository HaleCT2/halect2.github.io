# halect2.github.io
   > Personal React Playground hosted on my GitHub User Page

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Then the `build` folder is pushed upstream to the `master` branch of this repository,\
where it is deployed to [halect2.github.io](https://halect2.github.io/).
